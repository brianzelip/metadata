        <p>The sheer number of metadata standards in the cultural heritage sector is overwhelming, and their inter-relationships further complicate the situation.</p>
        <p>The 105 standards represented here are among those most heavily used or publicized in the cultural heritage community, though certainly not all standards that might be relevant are included.</p>
        <p>A small set of the metadata standards listed below include an asterisk* next to their name. These represent the most commonly known or discussed standards for cultural heritage metadata.</p>

            <dd>AACR2 is the primary content standard used in the library field in the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia. Its use is almost exclusive to libraries, although there have been calls for the archives and museum communities to adopt it for the description of “bibliographic” types of materials. While primarily focused on descriptive metadata, instructions exist that cover technical, rights, and structural metadata as well. AACR2 is scheduled to be replaced by RDA.</dd>

            <dd>The AAT is one of a suite of controlled vocabularies maintained by the Vocabulary Program at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles. It focuses on generic terms for the description of works of art, architecture, and material culture. The AAT is organized hierarchically within seven facets: associated concepts, physical proper- ties, styles and periods, agents, activities, materials, and objects. The vocabulary may be searched one term at a time freely on the web, and is available for license in bulk.</dd>

            <dd>The AES Audio Decision List (ADL) is a text-based file format and metadata standard for encoding the results of audio editing actions. The format records cuts, fades, the results of processing and filtering actions, and other edits to audio files made by a sound engineer. AES31-3 ADL support is included to some extent in audio editing software such as WaveLab and Pyramix.</dd>

            <dd>The AES Core Audio schema (in draft as X098B) is part of the Audio Engineering Society’s suite of standards for descriptive metadata for audio objects, although the AES uses the term “descriptive” differently than the library community does. The scope of the AES Core Audio standard is wide, including analog originals, digitally reformatted copies, and native digital recordings. The specification allows the capture of basic audio properties such as sample rate for digital files and groove width for physical discs. It also breaks audio objects down into "faces" (physical sides or directions for playback contiguously), "regions" (specific formats such as playing speed within a face), and “streams” (specific audio channels within a region). The AES Core Audio Schema and documentation are currently in draft status with no firm release date yet scheduled.</dd>
