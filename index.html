        <p>The sheer number of metadata standards in the cultural heritage sector is overwhelming, and their inter-relationships further complicate the situation.</p>
        <p>The 105 standards represented here are among those most heavily used or publicized in the cultural heritage community, though certainly not all standards that might be relevant are included.</p>
        <p>A small set of the metadata standards listed below include an asterisk* next to their name. These represent the most commonly known or discussed standards for cultural heritage metadata.</p>

Its use is almost exclusive to libraries, although there have been calls for the archives and museum communities to adopt it for the description of "bibliographic" types of materials. While primarily focused on descriptive metadata, instructions exist that cover technical, rights, and structural metadata as well. AACR2 is scheduled to be replaced by RDA.</dd>

            <dd>The AES Core Audio schema (in draft as X098B) is part of the Audio Engineering Society's suite of standards for descriptive metadata for audio objects, although the AES uses the term "descriptive" differently than the library community does. The scope of the AES Core Audio standard is wide, including analog originals, digitally reformatted copies, and native digital recordings. The specification allows the capture of basic audio properties such as sample rate for digital files and groove width for physical discs. It also breaks audio objects down into "faces" (physical sides or directions for playback contiguously), "regions" (specific formats such as playing speed within a face), and "streams" (specific audio channels within a region). The AES Core Audio Schema and documentation are currently in draft status with no firm release date yet scheduled.</dd>

It is an extensive set of descriptive elements, including 532 categories and subcategories. Usage guidelines distinguish between data elements intended for display and those intended for indexing. CDWA defines only category labels and definitions - it does not define a specific syntax for encoding them, although the CDWA guidelines suggest a relational structure providing for easy re-use of authority records. CDWA is commonly implemented in museum management software.</dd>

            <dd>Dublin Core is a widely misunderstood metadata stan- dard. The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DC- MES) is also known as Simple Dublin Core. Simple Dublin Core is a basic 15-element set designed to represent core features across all resource formats. It is standardized as ISO 15836-2003, ANSI/NISO Z39.85- 2007, and IETF RFC 5013. The Dublin Core Usage Guidelines sometimes suggest (but do not require) specific content guidelines or controlled vocabularies. Simple Dublin Core is widely known as the baseline metadata format required for all resources shared via OAI-PMH. Encoding of the DCMES in HTML <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags was popular in the early days of search engines, but today most search engines prefer to weigh page text and linking patterns more heavily then page creator-supplied structured metadata.</dd>

            <dd>The DCMI Abstract Model is a framework for the com- ponents of resource description and how they relate to one another. The structure of the DCAM is very similar to and inspired by the RDF model. The full model has three main sub-parts: the DCMI Resource Model, the DCMI Description Set Model, and the DCMI Vocabulary Model. These three work together to allow robust semantic relationships to be recorded between resources. The DCAM is a far cry from the 15 element set of simple Dublin Core that is familiar to many in the cultural heritage community, and represents a different and more robust approach to resource description. The DCAM is significantly more complex than the original simple Dublin Core, but offers a corresponding significant improvement in functionality and re-usability. Encodings of Dublin Core metadata in HTML, XML, and RDF all implement different subsets of the full DCAM.</dd>

            <dd>FOAF is an RDF syntax for describing people, intended to be used on the Semantic Web. It includes features for encoding names, email addresses, personal interests, home pages, and various online identities. Although the language is focused on people, encoding traditional library authority files in FOAF is challenging due to its assumption that each individual has only one FOAF identity and its focus on online presence for current living persons.</dd>

            <dd>FRAD is a companion document to the earlier FRBR conceptual model developed by IFLA. FRAD expands on FRBR by adding additional attributes to each of the Group 1, 2, and 3 entities; adding a new Group 2 entity (Family); and adding new entities intended to support the authority control process (Name, Identifier, Controlled Access Point, Rules, and Agency). Perhaps the strongest promise of the FRAD model is support for multi-lingual catalogs that can display to a user differ- ent forms of names for various entities depending on a user's location or language preferences.</dd>
            <dd>In addition to expanded entities and attributes, FRAD defines a different set of user tasks for authority data than FRBR did for bibliographic data. Here, the user tasks are Find, Identify, Contextualize, and Justify. The final FRAD report was published by IFLA in 2009.</dd>

            <dd>FRBR is a 1998 conceptual model of the biliographic universe, created in order to better understand the user tasks catalogs can and should support, and to suggest how bibliographic data might be viewed in support of these tasks. The most commonly known features of the FRBR report are its four user tasks (Find, Identify, Select, and Obtain) and the Group 1 Entities which cat- egorize the products of intellectual and artistic endeavors (Work, Expression, Manifestation, and Item). The FRBR report has other features as well, including Group 2 Entities representing the creators of Group 1 Entities (Person and Corporate Body), Group 3 Entities which are the subjects of Works (Group 1 Entities, Group 2 Entities, plus Concept, Object, Event, and Place), and minimal standards for national bibliographic records.</dd>
            <dd>The FRBR conceptual model has received a great deal of discussion in the cultural heritage community, but only in the very late 2000s have concrete implementations of the conceptual model into working systems begun to appear.</dd>

Linked data implementations are guided by four principles outlined by Tim Berners-Lee in 2006: 1) Use URIs as names for things, 2) Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names, 3) When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF, SPARQL), and 4) Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things. One of the highest profile uses of linked data in the cultural heritage community is <a href="http:// id.loc.gov">http://id.loc.gov</a>, although that service does not systematically implement the fourth principle of linked data - linking to other things. The records at <a href="http:// id.loc.gov">http:// id.loc.gov</a> point to other records in the same service, but not to data elsewhere on the web.

As a technical metadata format for still images, MIX can be used to describe images born digitally such as those taken with digital cameras, and images that have been reformatted from analog originals such as scans of photographs or pages of text. The data dictionary on which MIX is based includes four basic areas of metadata: basic digital object information, basic image information, image caputure metadata, and image assessment metadata. The MIX XML Schema is maintained by the Library of Congress.</dd>

            <dd>The Music Ontology is a framework for the description of musical materials intended to push these descriptions to the Semantic Web. It is divided into three levels allowing incremental increases in complexity. Level 1 is for basic descriptive information such as tracks, artists, and releases. Level 2 adds the music creation workflow such as arrangement, performance, and recording. Level 3 adds support for complex events such as timelines and relationships between performances. The Music Ontology uses FRBR principles to separate a musical Work from its Manifestations. It is expressed in RDF/OWL.</dd>

            <dd>MODS was developed by the Library of Congress Network Development and MARC Standards Office as a MARC-compatible metadata format expressed in XML and using language-based element names. MODS takes a similar approach to resource description as MARC, with some rearranging, removing, and adding of data elements. MODS is frequently used as a descriptive metadata structure standard inside METS metadata wrappers for storage or exchange of digital objects.</dd>

            <dd>DIDL is a component of the ISO/IEC 21000-2:2005 standard MPEG-21, and as such carries the same stan- darization weight MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and MPEG-7 carry. DIDL is a packaging format for digital objects, defining a data model for representing both content files and their metadata, and an XML wrapper format that conforms to the DIDL data model. The DIDL data model describes Containers, which can have Items, which group Components, which group individual datastreams called Resources. Descriptors apply to Containers, Items, or Resources. While MPEG21-DIDL is much less well known in the digital library community than METS, there are some high-profile implementations, such as that at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Digital Library.</dd>

            <dd>MPEG-7, unlike MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, is a standard for the description of the content of multimedia files, rather than a format for the multimedia files themselves. It is intended to provide structures for data both for human and machine users. The standard provides "description schemes" for a wide variety of uses. In addition to the high-level descriptions of content that will allow search and browse, there are description schemes for the cre- ation process, rights information, technical information, user history, and low-level features such as color, lighting level, and sound timbre.</dd>

            <dd>museumdat is a metadata structure standard for museums. It is based upon CDWA Lite, but while CDWA Lite has a heavy focus on works of art and material culture, museumdat also is appropriate for other types of museums such as technology and natural history. museumdat is defined in a W3C XML Schema. The current version is 1.0. There are ongoing efforts to harmonize CDWA Lite and museumdat into a new format called LIDO.</dd>
